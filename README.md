### Key Features
  - Instant index refresh (no need waiting refresh interval, just put games into folder and reload window)
  - Authentication through user:pass list string provided on Envs

## FAQ

- Q: Has Authentication ?

> R: Yes, you can thought AUTH_USERS env explained more at [`docker-compose.yml`](#docker-compose-sample-using-password) sample, (this block access to `/shop.json` on browser too)

```bash
  # before starts the server it shows which users has login credentials
  tinfoil-hat Auth Users Loaded: 'admin,other' +0ms
  tinfoil-hat ------------------ TinfoilHat Started v1.1.0 ------------------ +5ms
```

- Q: Why isn't showing all folders ? only showing `shop.json` and `shop.tfl` at home index ?

> R: To avoid a TINFOIL strange BUG when lists `shop.tfl` url. Basically when TINFOIL see too many folders on files index, home page (ex.: 100 folders links) TINFOIL can't traverse all html and reach `shop.tfl` file

## How works

1. Serve all games files and path statically
2. Serve web index to navigate like on PHP apache servers
3. Serve dynamically shop.json and shop.tfl as you place new games and files (fetch files and folders at every request)

# Docker-Compose Sample Using Password

```yml
version: "3"
services:
  tinfoil-hat:
    labels:
      # same scop used by watchtower to self update image
      - "com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.scope=tinfoilhat"
    container_name: tinfoil-hat
    build: .
    image: vinicioslc/tinfoil-hat:latest
    environment:
      # show all debug information on server logs (http info and more)
      - DEBUG=*
      # only show tinfoil-hat information on logs
      # - DEBUG=tinfoil-hat
      # users list authorized to access tinfoil-hat user and password separated by ":" and users separated by "," <your-user>:<your-pass>

    ports:
      # Change to any port of your machine (99 in that case) (dont change the :80 !!!)
      - 99:80
      # you can now access on your browser http://localhost:99/shop.json and see your games
    volumes:
      # path to your custom shop_template.jsonc used to show message on success or add authentication
      # - ./shop_template.jsonc:/shop_template.jsonc
      # mount your path to a directory with nsp,xci ...
      - /switch/games/:/games/
  # to enable auto update tinfoil-hat container

## We want but we can't

- [ ] Have a gui to override and customize TITLEID info on server-side json db
- [ ] Allow download torrent files from magnet link

#### when find server (save and restart tinfoil app)

## Which Tech Stack ?

- `express` | Serve Dynamically shop(.json|.tfl) with updated content at every refresh and serve files statically
- `serve-index` | To serve a rich listing of files (in case only shop.json shop.tfl for tinfoil)
- `json5` | To parse custom shop_template.jsonc (you can define on it custom content like a welcome message !!!)
