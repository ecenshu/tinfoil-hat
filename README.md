## FAQ

- Q: Why isn't showing all folders ? only showing shop.json and shop.tfl at home index ?

  R: To avoid a TINFOIL when it gets the `shop.tfl` url. When TINFOIL see too many folders on files index, home page (ex.: 100 folders links) TINFOIL can't traverse all html and reach `shop.tfl` file

## What it uses ?

- express |  Serve Dynamically shop(.json|.tfl) with updated content at every refresh
- express-static |  Serve all game files statically making possible download
- serve-index |  To serve a rich listing of files (in case only shop.json shop.tfl for tinfoil)
- json5 | To parse custom shop_template.jsonc (you can define on it custom content like a welcome message)

## How works

1. Serve all games files and path statically 
2. Serve web index to navigate like on PHP apache servers
3. Serve dynamically shop.json and shop.tfl as you place new games and files (fetch files and folders at every request)

# Example from a server runing with docker-compose.yml
```yml
version: "3"
services:
  tinfoil-hat:
    labels:
      # same scop used by watchtower to self update image
      - "com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.scope=tinfoilhat"
    container_name: tinfoil-hat
    build: .
    image: vinicioslc/tinfoil-hat:latest
    environment:
      # show all debug information on server logs (http info and more)
      - DEBUG=*
      # only show tinfoil information
      # - DEBUG=tinfoil-hat
    ports:
      # Change to any port of your machine (9009 in that case) (dont change the :80 !!!)
      - 9009:80
      # you can now access on your browser http://localhost:9009 and see your games
    volumes:
      # path to your custom shop_template.jsonc used to show message on success or add authentication
      # - ./shop_template.jsonc:/shop_template.jsonc
      # mount your path to a directory with nsp,xci ...
      - /switch/games/:/games/
  # to enable auto update tinfoil-hat container
