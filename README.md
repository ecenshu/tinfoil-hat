## FAQ

- Q: Has Authentication ?

> R: Yes, you can thought AUTH_USERS env explained more at [`docker-compose.yml`](#docker-compose-sample-using-password) sample, (this block access to `/shop.json` on browser too)

```bash
  # before starts the server it shows which users has login credentials
  tinfoil-hat Auth Users Loaded: 'admin,other' +0ms
  tinfoil-hat ------------------ TinfoilHat Started v1.1.0 ------------------ +5ms
```

- Q: Why isn't showing all folders ? only showing `shop.json` and `shop.tfl` at home index ?

> R: To avoid a TINFOIL strange BUG when lists `shop.tfl` url. Basically when TINFOIL see too many folders on files index, home page (ex.: 100 folders links) TINFOIL can't traverse all html and reach `shop.tfl` file

## How works

- Serve shop.json(for user check) and shop.tfl(for tinfoil) dynamically as you place new games and files on foilder (search files and folders at every refresh) this ensures a realtime Tinfoil listing files (you need reopen tinfoil to fully refresh index)

#### when find server (save and restart tinfoil app)

## Which Tech Stack ?

- `express` | Serve Dynamically shop(.json|.tfl) with updated content at every refresh and serve files statically
- `serve-index` | To serve a rich listing of files (in case only shop.json shop.tfl for tinfoil)
- `json5` | To parse custom shop_template.jsonc (you can define on it custom content like a welcome message !!!)
